**SUIM: Semantic Segmentation of Underwater Imagery** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the robotics industry and environmental research. 

The dataset consists of 1550 images with 5000 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *waterbody*, *fish_and_vertebrates*, *reefs_and_invertebrates*, and other: *sea-floor_and_rocks*, *human_divers*, *wrecks_and_ruins*, *aquatic_plants_and sea-grass*, and *robots*. There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (110 images) and *train_val* (1440 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the University of Minnesota.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 8 classes:
